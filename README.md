# Business Data Analysis – Hotel Bookings

End-to-end business data analysis project focused on revenue performance, cancellation behavior, and decision-making support using SQL and Power BI.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates real-world work of a data analyst supporting business decisions.  
The analysis was conducted end-to-end, from raw data preparation and KPI definition to SQL-based analysis and Power BI dashboards.

The main focus of the project is not only *what is happening in the data*, but *why it is happening and how the business can act on it*.

---

## Business Problem

Despite a high volume of bookings, the business struggles with revenue instability caused by a high cancellation rate and differences in performance across hotel types, segments, and channels.

The goal of this analysis was to:
- understand key revenue drivers
- identify high-risk and high-value segments
- support data-driven decisions to improve revenue stability

---

## Key KPIs

- Total Bookings  
- Net Revenue  
- Cancellation Rate  
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)

---

## Key Insights

- High booking volume does not directly translate into realized revenue due to a high cancellation rate (~37%).
- Revenue shows strong seasonality, indicating the need for month-specific pricing and booking policies.
- City Hotels generate higher net revenue but also carry higher cancellation risk than Resort Hotels.
- Market segments and distribution channels differ significantly in value and reliability.

## Dashboards (Power BI)

The analysis results were visualized using Power BI dashboards designed for executive-level decision support.

**Pages included:**
- **Executive Overview** – KPIs and monthly net revenue trend  
- **Segments** – revenue and cancellation analysis by hotel type, market segment, and distribution channel  

📸 Dashboard screenshots are available in the repository.

## SQL Analysis

All data preparation, KPI calculations, and aggregations were performed using SQL (SQLite).

**Main components:**
- Data cleaning and transformation
- KPI calculation
- Monthly and segment-level analysis
- Analytical views prepared for Power BI
